    * Edit the document by adding information about yourself to it.
    * This will be accomplished over the course of several days.
    * Use the skills learned in the HTML and CSS lessons to complete this project.
    * "Ask three before me"
        * We are here to help, but please check web resources or consult with peers prior to asking Instructor/TAs. This   helps build your "search muscles" which are very important to your future roles as Developers.
